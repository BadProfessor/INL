However, the truth is, eating five or more servings of fruit and vegetables a day is still your best bet for getting optimal nutrition. In addition, eating your veggies won\u0092t break the bank, like so many vitamin products can. If after eating real food for optimum nutrition, you still want to take a supplement, know that all supplements are not created equal. Select only vitamins that have been evaluated by a third party laboratory to ensure the contents in the bottle match the claims on the label.",

It may even seem like work has become a major obstacle to getting regular exercise. However, there are always ways to squeeze in fitness time, and every little bit really does count. For instance, instead of emailing, calling, or chatting a coworker, take the \u0093old-fashioned\u0094 approach and actually walk to their location. And, we\u0092ve all heard this before, but take the stairs instead of the elevator. The resulting calories burned and the muscle strength built, are well worth the effort.",

That\u0092s why it\u0092s up to you to make the conscious choice to slow down, take inventory on your health, and find ways to make improvements. The first place to start is with your annual physical. One simple visit to your doctor each year can be the most important thing you do for your health, and in most cases, it\u0092s completely covered by insurance. The annual exam can catch health issues, such as diabetes and cancer, in the early stages, giving you a much better chance at beating them down. Make a point of calling your doctor today and putting a wellness visit on your calendar. It\u0092s a great first step to prioritizing your health.",
