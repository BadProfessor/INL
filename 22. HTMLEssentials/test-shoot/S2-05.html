<p>We were walking down the street, and they said <q>Let’s stop here for coffee.</q> So we stopped.</p>

I wasn’t sure what to do. When I asked my mom, she quoted a famous Maya Angelou quote: 

What you’re supposed to do when you don’t like a thing is change it. If you can’t change it, change the way you think about it. Don’t complain. 

I’m not sure that’s helpful.

<p>We’ve gone from having 21 elements in HTML tags, that first document, to having 100 more elements now, and yet it’s still the same language. I find that amazing. It’s still the same language that was created 25 years ago. It’s grown an extra 100 elements in there, and yet it’s still the same language.</p>

<p>As my fellow HTML5 Doctor, Oli Studholme has showed, people seldom quote exactly
– so sacrosanctity of the quoted text isn’t a useful ideal – and in print etc,
citations almost always appear as part of the quotation – it’s highly conventional.</p>
