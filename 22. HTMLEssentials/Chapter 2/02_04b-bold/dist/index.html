<h1><strong>Warning!</strong> Do not be late.</h1>

<h2><strong>Chocolate and coffee</strong> and other things I crave</h2>







<p>This is a paragraph of text. Let’s pretend it’s part of a long article, where we expect many people to quickly scan through it, and <b>we want to mark certain phrases with some boldness</b>, some visual attention, so that those sentences jump out and people don’t miss them. Almost like having a pull-quote.</p>
