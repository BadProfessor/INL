  <!-- Examples from the second slide -->
  <!-- The first example would show the the alt text if the src file wasn't provided -->
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Cups of coffee">
  <!-- The next two don't look any different because they require extra CSS code to define what #firstline and .indented look like. -->
