# Variables and Constants
---
 
## Topic Essentials
Declaring variables in Swift depends on how you plan to use their values in your code.
 + The `var` keyword declares a variable that can be changed at any time.
 + The `let` keyword declares a variable as a constant, which cannot be changed after it's value is assigned.
 
### Objectives
+ Create a variable called **currentHealth** and assign it a value of 90.
+ Create a constant called **maxHealth** with a value of 100.
+ Try and change **currentHealth** and **maxHealth** to different values.
