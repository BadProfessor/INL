/*:
 # The SWITCH Statement
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 A switch statement takes a value and runs it against possible matching patterns, with each possible match having a different block of executable code. While that might sound boring, switch statements in Swift have a lot of features that make them excellent for decision logic.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Use a switch statement to execute different code for different **initial** values
 + Use a switch statement to evaluate multiple variables
 + Use value binding and the `where` keyword to add logic to more cases
