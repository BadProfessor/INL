 # Chapter Challenge: Game Logic

 ### Tasks
 1. Create two optional string variable called **lefthandWeapon** and **righthandWeapon**. Assigning them initial values is at your discretion.
 2. Use optional binding to unwrap both optionals in a single statement and debug both outcomes.
 3. Create a dictionary called **playerExp** and assign it some key-value pairs of type string and integer.
 4. Use a `for-in` loop to iterate over **playerExp** and capture the keys and values.
 5. Add a `guard` statement inside the `for-in` loop to make sure each player is at least level 1 to proceed. Don't forget to include the `continue` keyword.
 6. Use a switch statement to define the following cases:
    6a. exp is equal to 32
    6b. exp is between 200 and 500
    6c. Use value binding to store exp and check that it is greater than 500 using the `where` keyword
