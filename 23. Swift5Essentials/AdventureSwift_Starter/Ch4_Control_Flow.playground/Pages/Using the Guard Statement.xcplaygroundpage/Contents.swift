/*:
 # Using the GUARD Statement
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 
 Guard statements in Swift act like gate keepers. Code execution can only get past them if their condition is true, otherwise the else statement that accompanies every guard statement will execute.
 
 Guard statements are great for setting up requirements in your code and making sure you donâ€™t have unforeseen errors down the line.

 
 ### Objectives
 + Use a for loop to iterate over **shopItems**
 + Add a `guard` statement to check if you have enough gold to purchase each item
 + Debug both cases inside the for loop
