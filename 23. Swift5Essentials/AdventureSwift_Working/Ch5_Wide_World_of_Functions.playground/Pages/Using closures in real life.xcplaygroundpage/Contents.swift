 # Using Closures IRL
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 There are several ways to use closures now that we know how their syntax works, including with Swift functions that perform operations based on predicates or as input parameters and return values for our own custom functions.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Call the `sorted` function on an array and use the closure to order the items
 + Create a function that takes in a closure as a parameter
 + Create another function that uses a closure as its return type
 + Understand the use cases of these different approaches
