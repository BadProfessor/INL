 # Understanding Closures
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 Like functions, closures are enclosed blocks of functionality but with more concise syntax. In Swift closures act like blocks or lambda expressions in other programming languages, allowing us to pass function-like operations around like variables.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Write an empty closure declaration
 + Create a closure that takes in an `Int` parameter and returns an `Int` value
 + Update the closure to use type inference and shorthand
