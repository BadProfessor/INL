 # Swift Enumerations
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 Swift enumerations allow you to put related values together into a group that you can use and access. Like switch statements, each value in an enum is considered a different case, which is one of the many reasons they go so well together.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Declare a basic enum called **GameState**
 + Store an enum case as a variable and print out its value
 + Use a switch statement to define actions for each enum case
 + Understand default cases and the **@unknown** keyword
