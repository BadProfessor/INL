 # Introducing Protocols
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 Swift protocols are essentially groups of properties and behaviors that can be adopted by a class or struct. If a class or struct implements a protocol, that class or struct enters into an agreement that says they will follow the blueprint the protocol has set out.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Declare a protocol
 + Add properties, a function and an initializer
 + Create a struct that adopts the protocol
 + Adopt multiple protocols
