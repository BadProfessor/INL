 # Core Array Methods
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 Now that we know how to create and access arrays, we need to learn how to dynamically modify them. Like `Strings`, `Arrays` come with several handy methods built right in for just that purpose.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create an array called **characterClasses** and assign it initial values
 + Use `append` and += operator to add items
 + Use the `insert` and `remove` methods to change the array further
 + Explore the `reverse`, `contains`, and`sort` methods
 + Create a jagged array called **skillTree** that stores arrays as its values
 + Use chained **subscript syntax** to access a value in **skillTree**
