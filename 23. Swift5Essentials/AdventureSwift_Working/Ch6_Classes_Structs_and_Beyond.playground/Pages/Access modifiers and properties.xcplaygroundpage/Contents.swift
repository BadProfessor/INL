 # Access Modifiers and Properties

 ## Topic Essentials
 Like most programming languages, swift allows you to limit, or control, how classes, structs, properties, and other entities are accessed based on the module or file theyâ€™re in. There are four levels of access in swift, public, internal, file private, and private.
 
 Swift also allows properties to be declared as static, class, read-only and read-write.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Explore the four available access levels
 + Add a read-only (computed) property to Adventurer
 + Add a read-write property to Adventurer
 + Add a static and class property to Adventurer
