 # Basic Swift Classes

 ## Topic Essentials
 Even though swift has an entire library of built-in classes and structs for us to use in our applications, weâ€™ll still need to know how to create our own. These data structures can have properties, methods, initializers, and in the case of classes can have their own subclasses.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create a simple class called **Adventurer**
 + Declare instance properties with or without values
 + Define designated and convenience initializers
 + Understand reference type behavior
